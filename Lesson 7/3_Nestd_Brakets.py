# A string S consisting of N characters is called properly nested if:

# S is empty;
# S has the form "(U)" where U is a properly nested string;
# S has the form "VW" where V and W are properly nested strings.
# For example, string "(()(())())" is properly nested but string "())" isn't.

# Write a function:

# def solution(S)

# that, given a string S consisting of N characters, returns 1 if string S is properly nested and 0 otherwise.

# For example, given S = "(()(())())", the function should return 1 and given S = "())", the function should return 0, as explained above.

# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

# N is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000];
# string S is made only of the characters '(' and/or ')'.
